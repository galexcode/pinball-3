# Pinball

I took at Computer graphics class to learn more about the graphics pipeline, rendering process and such. As the final project for the class, we were tasked with writing a pinball game in the language of our choice. I chose to use Python because I didn't really know it that well at the time, and used OpenGL because the Python bindings work well and I had a bit of experience with it.

The game itself works great. The collision detection is a little iffy at times, but that's life. :P

Just run pinball.py and you are set. The program has usage, but it is mostly for debugging and demoing purposes in the class itself.

Use 'Z' and  '/' keys to control the paddles and press space to fire the ball. You can also use 'M' to toggle between viewing the game board from angled view, top view, and from the ball's view. You can also change the key bindings by right clicking, though the settings are not saved the next time you open.

The game uses '.ac' files generated by the terrible program 'AC3D' that we had to use. The program uses the names of various parts of the model to decide behavior, so if you wanted you could tweak the game board or make your own by supplying a new '.ac' file.
